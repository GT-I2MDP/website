      <h2>Task overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our challenge focuses on developing methods for lung nodule detection and lung nodule classification from Chest X-Ray images.
        <ol>
          <li>Lung nodule detection is performed through a lung classification task into two categories, lung containing nodules and healthy lungs.</li>
          <li>Lung nodule localization which consists of finding the center point of nodules in chest x-ray images.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      <p>
        The competition is open to any <strong>academic teams</strong> from universities and or research institutes of which at least one member holds a Ph.D in computer science, biomedical engineering, or radiology.
      </p>

      <h2>Datasets</h2>
      <p>
        The competitors will be provided with a single original dataset including 66110 images of frontal radiographs as JPG images and associated ground truths, namely class label (presence, absence of nodules), and pixel coordinates corresponding to positions of nodules for a subset of images labeled nodule positive. This set has been generated by filtering existing datasets. 
        <strong>The participants can train their models on additional datasets upon request and organizer authorization. If this rule is not respected, the team’s work will not be considered for the competition.</strong>

        The dataset for this challenge comes from two sources, introducing natural variability in acquisition protocols and patient populations. The dataset also contains relatively few annotated images for the second task, reflecting real-world challenges in handling class imbalance and heterogeneous data. By framing the challenge around these constraints, we aim to highlight scientifically relevant issues and encourage the development of algorithms that are robust, generalizable, and clinically meaningful.
        
        The test set that will be used in the experimental study comes from a different data source which differs from the training dataset.

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        Classification metrics: For the classification task, standard metrics will be used, including accuracy, recall, precision, F1.
        Localization metrics: For the localization task, a custom metric based on weighted distances will be used.
